## Details
This is my first ever flutter project and its a game that features separate flag icons which functionas buttons for the player to click. The player must guess the flag of the country displayed. Their score is tracked.

## Installation
The game is written in Dart using the Flutter package which both need to be installed in order for the code to be used. I personally used the Android Studio IDE but you can use any IDE capable of running Flutter and writing code in Dart.
